Primary Key :

A primary is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies tuples (rows)
 in that table.
 
 --------------------------------------
 Foreign key :
  
 Foreign keys are the columns of a table that points to the primary key of another table.
  They act as a cross-reference between tables.
  
  Example : A column in one table which is a primary key for another table is nothing 
  but Foreign Key.
